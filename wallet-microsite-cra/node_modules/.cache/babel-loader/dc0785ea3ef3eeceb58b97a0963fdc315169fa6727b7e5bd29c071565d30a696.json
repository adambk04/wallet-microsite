AEON Wallet Application Software (&ldquo;the Application&rdquo;)</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.1.1.</strong> In order to use the AEON Wallet, you are required to download the application software from Google Playstore or Apple Store to your Device, and thereafter register the AEON Wallet with AEON Credit through the application. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.1.2.</strong> AEON Credit is not responsible or liable in any way for your access to the Google Playstore and Apple Store. You are solely responsible for the installation, configuration or compatibility of the hardware, software and other equipment used for installation of the AEON Wallet application on your Device. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2. Your Responsibilities </strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2.1.</strong> You agree to register for the AEON Wallet and provide true, accurate, current and complete information as prompted by AEON Wallet's registration form (\"Registration Data\"). If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if AEON Credit has reasonable grounds to believe that any information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, AEON Credit has the right to suspend or terminate your access to AEON Wallet and refuse any and all current or future use of AEON Wallet (or any part thereof) without any liability. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2.2.</strong> You shall ensure the compatibility of your mobile device with AEON Wallet. In the event that changes and upgrades are introduced to AEON Wallet, you shall be responsible to ensure the continued compatibility of your Device and you shall have no claim whatsoever against AEON Credit arising therefrom.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2.3.</strong> You shall be responsible for any Device, software and mobile network/data services necessary to use AEON Wallet and also for ensuring accuracy of information or transaction data submitted or confirmed by you through the use of the AEON Wallet; and</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2.4</strong> You shall not install the Application on a jail-broken or rooted Device. Unauthorised modifications to any Device(s) operating systems (\"jail-breaking or rooting\") bypass security features and can cause numerous issues to the hacked devices; thus such Device(s)are vulnerable to fraudulent attacks and may expose your Account(s) registered under AEON Wallet being used by unauthorised persons, whether remotely performed or otherwise.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2.5.</strong> You shall be solely responsible for all fees and charges related to access and connection to the AEON Wallet including but not limited to phone/telecommunication usage, mobile data usage charges and any other charges imposed by any Network/Wifi Service Provider.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2.6.</strong> Your AEON Wallet cannot be transferred and you must be the individual holding the NRIC or passport number registered with AEON Credit. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.2.7</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the PIN for the Application, and you shall be fully responsible for all activities/transactions made with your PIN or Account. AEON Credit will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to take reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of your Account or PIN, your failure to exit from the Application immediately upon ceasing to using the Application for any transaction or enquiry, or your negligence in safeguarding/securing Device against loss or theft. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.3.</strong> <strong>Use of AEON Wallet </strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.3.1.</strong> By installing the Application, you represent and warrant that you are the person holding the relevant credit card, prepaid card, loyalty programme/membership or other account with AEON Credit to be enrolled for utilisation in the AEON Wallet.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.3.2.</strong> By using the Application, you agree and undertake to use the Application functions in accordance with these Terms of Usage, and accept the risk that by enabling the Application on your Device, unauthorised access may arise using your login information, and you will be liable solely for all information accessed or transactions performed by any other person without your knowledge, authority or consent. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>2.3.3. </strong>References to material and information contained on AEON Wallet include such material and information provided by third parties.
